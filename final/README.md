Not really, I used mostly information I learned during the semester.
I learned how to make a gallery kind of which was really cool but other than that I mostly just used information I learned during the semester.
I started by deciding what I wanted to do and picking out colors I wanted to use and then I assembled my website with dummy text and then went back and filled it in with the correct information.
