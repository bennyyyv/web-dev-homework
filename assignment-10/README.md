Web-safe fonts are fonts that are installed on most computers and therefore can be viewed by most computers by default. Web fonts are fonts found on the web that are being linked to on your page. A system font is the font that things are shown in my default on your computer.
A fallback font makes sure that even if the viewer cannot view the font that your webpage is being displayed in they can still see the information.
I started by finding the text I wanted to use in this assignment. I chose Harry Potter because it is one of my favorite book and movie franchise. The third one is just the first one I could find in text form online. Then I started creating my divs and selecting colors that I thought worked well together. I also arranged the text in the same way it is found in the book because I think it looks much better that way. Then I just followed the steps listed on Moodle and finished the assignment.
