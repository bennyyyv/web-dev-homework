My imaginary client was an design group. A lot of design and digital media companies have sort of weird websites that aren't structured like normal businesses and that's why I made all my pages very similar. I imagine that real text on those pages would discuss their vision and purpose and very abstract things rather than facts and figures like other companies.
A block element would just be a block like any other element really. An inline element would fill the inside of a different container. An inline block would create a block inside a different container.
I started by watching the tutorial on how to create a dropdown menu. Then I brainstormed various website designs until I finally went with the simplest option because I was getting frustrated. Then I created the fillings for the pages and put it all together.
