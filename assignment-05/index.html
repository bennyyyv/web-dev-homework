    <h1>Chicken Pot Pie</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      2 cups diced peeled potatoes,
      1-3/4 cups sliced carrots,
      2/3 cup chopped onion,
      1 cup butter, cubed,
      1 cup all-purpose flour,
      1-3/4 teaspoons salt,
      1 teaspoon dried thyme,
      3/4 teaspoon pepper,
      3 cups chicken broth,
      1-1/2 cups whole milk,
      4 cups cubed cooked chicken,
      1 cup frozen peas,
      1 cup frozen corn,
      4 sheets refrigerated pie crust.
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to <em>425째</em>. Place potatoes and carrots in a large saucepan; add water to cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cook, covered, 8-10 minutes or until crisp-tender; drain.</li>
      <li>In a large skillet, heat butter over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until tender. Stir in flour and seasonings until blended. Gradually stir in broth and milk. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly; cook and stir 2 minutes or until thickened. Stir in chicken, peas, corn and potato mixture; remove from heat.</li>
      <li>Unroll a pie crust into each of two 9-in. pie plates; trim even with rims. Add chicken mixture. Unroll remaining crusts; place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edges. Cut slits in tops.</li>
      <li>Bake <strong>35-40 minutes</strong> or until crust is lightly browned. Let stand 15 minutes before cutting.
Freeze option: Cover and freeze unbaked pies. To use, remove from freezer 30 minutes before baking (do not thaw). Preheat oven to 425째. Place pies on baking sheets; cover edges loosely with foil. Bake 30 minutes. Reduce oven setting to 350째; bake 70-80 minutes longer or until crust is golden brown and a thermometer inserted in center reads 165째.</li>
