![My Layout](./images/layout.jpg)
I started by browsing the Awwwards website for a website I wanted to model mine after. I chose the Kommigraphics In SOTD site and made a mockup in Photoshop. I then arranged my containers in the way that I wanted to which was way way harder than I thought it would be so I had to sacrifice a little in my design because it was just going to be too difficult and time consuming. Then I filled dummy info into the various containers so that it looked more put together.
